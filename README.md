# Efficient MNIST Classifier: A Deep Dive into Constrained Optimization

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of a highly efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification, built using PyTorch. The core of this assignment was not just to build a classifier, but to solve a constrained optimization problem. The challenge was to design a model that simultaneously achieves elite-level accuracy while adhering to strict limitations on parameter count and training epochs.

This project demonstrates a deep understanding of modern CNN architecture, including strategic use of Batch Normalization, Dropout for regularization, and Global Average Pooling (GAP) for extreme parameter efficiency.

## Final Results Analysis

The final model successfully meets the parameter and epoch constraints while coming extremely close to the accuracy target. The analysis of the training log provides critical insights into the final steps required to cross the 99.4% threshold.

### Log Narrative & Discussion

The training log reveals a classic optimization story with clear evidence of a well-performing model that is on the verge of its goal.

1.  **Initial Convergence (Epochs 1-6):** The model demonstrates healthy and rapid learning with the initial learning rate of `0.002`. The validation accuracy quickly climbs from a baseline to over 98.7%, showing the architecture is effective.

2.  **Fine-Tuning Phase 1 (Epochs 7-13):** The `StepLR` scheduler correctly drops the learning rate after epoch 7. This is the most crucial phase of training. The smaller learning rate allows the model to make more precise adjustments, causing the validation accuracy to jump significantly from 98.52% to 99.23%. The model achieves its **peak validation accuracy of 99.29% at epoch 13**.

3.  **Performance Plateau & Overfitting (Epochs 14-20):** After the final learning rate drop, the model's performance on the validation set plateaus. It hovers around 99.25% and does not improve further. Crucially, during this phase, the **Training Accuracy continues to climb to 99.63%**, while the Validation Accuracy stagnates. This widening gap is a clear, textbook sign of slight **overfitting**. The model is becoming exceptionally good at memorizing the training data but is losing its ability to generalize to the unseen validation data.

This analysis is invaluable: it shows that the model has sufficient capacity but requires slightly stronger regularization to bridge the final gap between memorization and true generalization to achieve the 99.4% target.

## Architectural Deep Dive & Guideline Compliance

This section provides a detailed breakdown of how the model's architecture satisfies the core requirements of the assignment.

### 1. Total Parameter Count Test

**Status: Compliant**

The assignment strictly requires the model to have fewer than 20,000 trainable parameters. The final architecture was meticulously designed to meet this constraint without sacrificing depth or performance.

-   **Constraint:** < 20,000
-   **Actual:** 19,664
-   **Methodology:** The parameter count is calculated programmatically in the `train.py` script using a helper function that iterates through the model's layers and sums the number of elements in each trainable weight tensor. This ensures an accurate and verifiable count, which is printed at the start of every run. The low count is primarily achieved by avoiding traditional dense layers and using techniques like 1x1 convolutions.

### 2. Use of Batch Normalization

**Status: Implemented**

Batch Normalization (`nn.BatchNorm2d`) is a non-negotiable component of this modern CNN architecture. It is applied after every single `nn.Conv2d` layer.

-   **Mechanism and Placement:** It is placed immediately after the convolution and before the ReLU activation function. In this position, it normalizes the output of the convolution, ensuring that the activations fed into the ReLU function are consistently distributed around a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
-   **Purpose and Benefits:** This normalization is critical for two reasons. First, it mitigates the problem of "internal covariate shift," where the distribution of layer inputs changes during training, making it difficult for the model to learn. Second, it creates a smoother loss landscape, which allows the optimizer to take larger, more confident steps. This directly enables the use of a higher initial learning rate, leading to faster convergence and a more stable training process overall.

### 3. Use of Dropout

**Status: Implemented**

Dropout (`nn.Dropout`) is strategically employed as the primary regularization technique to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization capabilities.

-   **Mechanism and Placement:** Dropout layers with a rate of `p=0.1` are placed after the ReLU activation in the deeper convolutional blocks (blocks 2, 3, and 4). During training, these layers randomly set 10% of the incoming activations to zero for each forward pass. This prevents the network from becoming too reliant on specific activation paths.
-   **Strategic Application:** Dropout is deliberately omitted from the first convolutional block. The initial layer is responsible for learning fundamental, low-level features (like edges and corners) that are critical for the rest of the network. Applying dropout here could be detrimental. By applying it only in deeper layers, we regularize the learning of more complex feature combinations, which is where overfitting is most likely to occur. The final log analysis suggests that this regularization was crucial, and a slightly higher rate could be the key to hitting the final accuracy target.

### 4. Use of a Fully Connected Layer or GAP

**Status: Global Average Pooling (GAP) Implemented**

The model explicitly uses Global Average Pooling (`nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d`) as a modern, efficient alternative to a traditional fully connected layer. This is the single most important design choice for meeting the parameter constraint.

-   **Mechanism vs. Fully Connected Layer:** A traditional approach would flatten the final `8x8x32` feature map into a vector of 2,048 elements and connect it to a 10-neuron output layer, creating over 20,000 parameters in that one connection. Instead, GAP reduces each of the 32 feature maps to a single number by averaging all the values within that map. This collapses the `8x8x32` tensor to a `1x1x32` tensor using zero parameters.
-   **Dual Advantage:**
    1.  **Parameter Efficiency:** It drastically reduces the number of parameters, making the model lightweight and less prone to overfitting.
    2.  **Structural Regularization:** By averaging across spatial dimensions, GAP is inherently more robust to the spatial location of features in the input image. A final 1x1 convolution then acts as a lightweight linear classifier on these 32 channel-wise features, providing the final 10 class scores. This entire output block is both highly performant and incredibly efficient.
