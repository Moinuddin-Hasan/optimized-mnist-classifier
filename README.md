# Efficient MNIST Classifier: A Deep Dive into Constrained Optimization

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of a highly efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification, built using PyTorch. The core of this assignment was not just to build a classifier, but to solve a constrained optimization problem. The challenge was to design a model that simultaneously achieves elite-level accuracy while adhering to strict limitations on parameter count and training epochs.

This project demonstrates a deep understanding of modern CNN architecture, including strategic use of Batch Normalization, Dropout for regularization, and Global Average Pooling (GAP) for extreme parameter efficiency.

### Log Narrative & Discussion

The training process can be broken down into three distinct phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Rapid Convergence (Epochs 1-4):** With a relatively high initial learning rate of `0.002`, the model learns very quickly. The validation accuracy jumps from an initial guess to over 98.6% in just four epochs. This indicates that the model architecture and the Adam optimizer are well-suited for the problem.

2.  **Phase 2: Approaching the Plateau (Epochs 5-7):** The rate of improvement slows down as the model begins to learn the finer details of the dataset. The validation accuracy hovers around the 98.7% mark, suggesting that the initial high learning rate is no longer optimal for finding a deeper minimum in the loss landscape.

3.  **Phase 3: Fine-Tuning and Goal Achievement (Epochs 8-13):** The `StepLR` scheduler triggers at the end of Epoch 7, reducing the learning rate by a factor of 10 to `0.0002`. This is the most critical phase. The reduced learning rate allows the model to fine-tune its weights with much smaller adjustments. The impact is immediate and significant: the validation accuracy jumps from 98.52% to **99.23%** in a single epoch. Over the next few epochs, this fine-tuning pushes the model's generalization capability over the **99.4%** threshold, achieving the assignment's primary goal in just 13 epochs. The training stops here as the condition has been met.

## Architectural Deep Dive & Guideline Compliance

This section details how the final model architecture complies with the mandatory components of the assignment.

### 1. Total Parameter Count Test

The total number of trainable parameters is a primary constraint. The architecture was specifically designed to stay under the **20,000** parameter limit, primarily through the use of Global Average Pooling.

**Result:**
- **Constraint:** < 20,000
- **Actual:** 19,664
- **Status:** **PASS**

### 2. Use of Batch Normalization

**Status: Implemented**

Batch Normalization (`nn.BatchNorm2d`) is a core component of every convolutional block in the network, placed immediately after each `nn.Conv2d` layer.

**Purpose & Placement:**
- It normalizes the activations of the previous layer, which drastically stabilizes the training process and prevents issues like vanishing or exploding gradients.
- By placing it before the ReLU activation, it ensures that the inputs to the activation function are centered around zero, which is their most effective range. This stability allows for faster and more reliable training.

### 3. Use of Dropout

**Status: Implemented**

Dropout (`nn.Dropout`) is strategically introduced in the deeper convolutional blocks of the model (blocks 2, 3, and 4) with a rate of `p=0.1`.

**Purpose & Placement:**
- **Why not in the first layer?** The first layer learns fundamental features like edges and curves. Applying dropout here can be counterproductive as these features are essential building blocks.
- **Why in deeper layers?** Deeper layers learn more complex and potentially redundant feature combinations. Dropout here forces the network to develop a more robust understanding of the data by preventing it from relying on any single feature path. This directly combats overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to the unseen validation set.

### 4. Use of a Fully Connected Layer or GAP

**Status: Global Average Pooling (GAP) Implemented**

The model uses `nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)` at the end of the feature extraction pipeline.

**Purpose & Advantage:**
- **Extreme Parameter Efficiency:** A traditional `Flatten` followed by an `nn.Linear` layer on the final 8x8x32 feature map would have resulted in `(8 * 8 * 32) * 10 = 20,480` parameters in that layer alone, instantly violating the assignment's constraint.
- **Structural Regularization:** GAP is a powerful regularizer. It averages out spatial information, making the model more robust to translations of the digit within the receptive field. The final classification is performed by a 1x1 convolution, which acts as a lightweight, parameter-efficient equivalent of a linear layer in this context, only adding `32 * 10 = 320` parameters. This design choice is the single most important factor in meeting the parameter constraint while maintaining a deep, powerful network.
