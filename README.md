# Efficient MNIST Classifier: A Deep Dive into Constrained Optimization

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of a highly efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification, built using PyTorch. The core of this assignment was not just to build a classifier, but to solve a constrained optimization problem. The challenge was to design a model that simultaneously achieves elite-level accuracy while adhering to strict limitations on parameter count and training epochs.

This project demonstrates a deep understanding of modern CNN architecture, including strategic use of Batch Normalization, Dropout for regularization, and Global Average Pooling (GAP) for extreme parameter efficiency.

## Final Results: Target Achieved

The final model successfully meets or exceeds all assignment criteria by the end of the 20-epoch training cycle.

### Log Narrative & Discussion

The training log clearly illustrates the model's journey to high accuracy.

1.  **Initial Convergence (Epochs 1-7):** The model starts with a high learning rate (`0.002`), allowing it to learn the broad features of the dataset quickly. During this phase, the validation accuracy rapidly climbs to over 98.7%, but the rate of improvement begins to slow, indicating that a more delicate approach is needed to find a better solution.

2.  **Primary Fine-Tuning (Epochs 8-14):** At the end of epoch 7, the `StepLR` scheduler reduces the learning rate by 90% to `0.0002`. This is the most critical phase. The smaller learning rate allows the optimizer to make much finer adjustments to the model's weights. The impact is immediate, with the validation accuracy jumping from the 98.5% range to consistently above 99.2%. The target accuracy of **99.4% is first achieved at epoch 13**.

3.  **Final Refinement (Epochs 15-20):** A final learning rate drop to `0.00002` occurs after epoch 14. This allows the model to settle into the deepest possible minimum it has found. During this phase, the model achieves its peak performance of **99.45% at epoch 17**. The subsequent epochs show extremely stable performance, with minimal fluctuations in loss and accuracy, indicating that the model has fully converged and further training is unlikely to yield significant gains. The final model is saved at its peak performance, successfully exceeding the project's goal.

## Architectural Deep Dive & Guideline Compliance

This section provides a detailed breakdown of how the model's architecture satisfies the core requirements of the assignment.

### 1. Total Parameter Count Test

**Status: Compliant**

The assignment strictly requires the model to have fewer than 20,000 trainable parameters. The final architecture was meticulously designed to meet this constraint without sacrificing depth or performance.

-   **Constraint:** < 20,000
-   **Actual:** 19,664
-   **Methodology:** The parameter count is calculated programmatically in the `train.py` script using a helper function that iterates through the model's layers and sums the number of elements in each trainable weight tensor. This ensures an accurate and verifiable count, which is printed at the start of every run. The low count is primarily achieved by avoiding traditional dense layers and using techniques like 1x1 convolutions.

### 2. Use of Batch Normalization

**Status: Implemented**

Batch Normalization (`nn.BatchNorm2d`) is a non-negotiable component of this modern CNN architecture. It is applied after every single `nn.Conv2d` layer.

-   **Mechanism and Placement:** It is placed immediately after the convolution and before the ReLU activation function. In this position, it normalizes the output of the convolution, ensuring that the activations fed into the ReLU function are consistently distributed around a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
-   **Purpose and Benefits:** This normalization is critical for two reasons. First, it mitigates the problem of "internal covariate shift," where the distribution of layer inputs changes during training, making it difficult for the model to learn. Second, it creates a smoother loss landscape, which allows the optimizer to take larger, more confident steps. This directly enables the use of a higher initial learning rate, leading to faster convergence and a more stable training process overall.

### 3. Use of Dropout

**Status: Implemented**

Dropout (`nn.Dropout`) is strategically employed as the primary regularization technique to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization capabilities.

-   **Mechanism and Placement:** Dropout layers with a rate of `p=0.1` are placed after the ReLU activation in the deeper convolutional blocks (blocks 2, 3, and 4). During training, these layers randomly set 10% of the incoming activations to zero for each forward pass. This prevents the network from becoming too reliant on specific activation paths.
-   **Strategic Application:** Dropout is deliberately omitted from the first convolutional block. The initial layer is responsible for learning fundamental, low-level features (like edges and corners) that are critical for the rest of the network. Applying dropout here could be detrimental. By applying it only in deeper layers, we regularize the learning of more complex feature combinations, which is where overfitting is most likely to occur.

### 4. Use of a Fully Connected Layer or GAP

**Status: Global Average Pooling (GAP) Implemented**

The model explicitly uses Global Average Pooling (`nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d`) as a modern, efficient alternative to a traditional fully connected layer. This is the single most important design choice for meeting the parameter constraint.

-   **Mechanism vs. Fully Connected Layer:** A traditional approach would flatten the final `8x8x32` feature map into a vector of 2,048 elements and connect it to a 10-neuron output layer, creating over 20,000 parameters in that one connection. Instead, GAP reduces each of the 32 feature maps to a single number by averaging all the values within that map. This collapses the `8x8x32` tensor to a `1x1x32` tensor using zero parameters.
-   **Dual Advantage:**
    1.  **Parameter Efficiency:** It drastically reduces the number of parameters, making the model lightweight and less prone to overfitting.
    2.  **Structural Regularization:** By averaging across spatial dimensions, GAP is inherently more robust to the spatial location of features in the input image. A final 1x1 convolution then acts as a lightweight linear classifier on these 32 channel-wise features, providing the final 10 class scores. This entire output block is both highly performant and incredibly efficient.
